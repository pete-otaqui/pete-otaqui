        <p>For years now I’ve heard tell of ‘Sparkle’, Microsoft’s supposed alternative to the Flash player / platform. At the time of this writing
          <a href="http://search.microsoft.com/results.aspx?mkt=en-US&amp;setlang=en-US&amp;q=sparkle">you can find search results on mcrosoft.com about sparkle</a>, but few of those pages exist, and none of the actual product links. I’m guessing, but I think that their new product
          <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/default_01.aspx">Silverlight</a>  is the same thing rebranded, and is certainly being
          <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/04/16/microsoft-adobe-smackdown/">touted as a smackdown-style competitor to Flash</a> .</p>
        <p>Adobe isn’t resting on its laurels, though –
          <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/04/16/microsoft-adobe-smackdown/">Mashable also reports that Adobe’s new Media Player is a direct competitor to Windows Media Player</a> .</p>
        <p>I can’t really see either platform having too much success in the short term since Flash not only has player-ubiquity on it’s side, but a huge developer-base; while in the media player world I still suspect a huge number of users don’t even know
          what one is, let alone why you would go and install another one and go through all the file- and mime-type hassles that entails.</p>
        <p><strong>Update:</strong> 
          <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/30/silverlight-the-web-just-got-richer/">Techcrunch has quite a bit more information about the silverlight platform</a>  … and it actually sounds quite nice, although I’m not convinced that it will be that great for designers (not that I am one …)</p>
