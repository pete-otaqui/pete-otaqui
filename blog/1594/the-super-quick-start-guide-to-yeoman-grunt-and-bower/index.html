        <p>
          <a href="http://yeoman.io">Yeoman</a>  is a fantastic tool for giving you a standardised, thought out, useful project structure for html and javascript applications.</p>
        <p>The only thing I think it lacks is a really straightforward quickstart guide for new users, hence this blog post.</p>
        <p><span id="more-1594"></span> </p>
        <h2>Step 0: Requirements</h2>
        <p>Yeoman may not work or have more trouble running in Windows. &nbsp;Get yourself a Linux Virtual Machine, at once, and do all the following steps inside there.</p>
        <h2>Step 1: Get Node / NPM</h2>
        <p>You will need to install
          <a title="NodeJS" href="http://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>  in a manner suitable for your platform. &nbsp;This should (hopefully) come with
          <a href="http://npmjs.org/">NPM</a>  as well, or if you not you will also need to install that.</p>
        <h2>Step 2: Install yeoman, grunt and bower</h2>
        <p>Note that the yeoman package is called “yo” and the grunt package is called “grunt-cli”.</p>
        <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">$ npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower
</pre>
        <h2>Step 3: Get the generator(s) of your choice</h2>
        <p>Yeoman uses “generators” to actually create project setups. &nbsp;The “standard” one is called “generator-webapp” but there are many others you may want to look at.</p>
        <p>Find project generators like this (unfortunately not necessarily namespaced in any way with “yeoman”, so you will get false positives):</p>
        <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">$ npm search generator
</pre>
        <p>Note that throughout 2013, yeoman underwent&nbsp;<em>significant</em>  changes, so if a generator package hasn’t been updated since March or April of 2013, you may want to avoid it.</p>
        <p>To get the standard “webapp” generator you want to do this:</p>
        <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">$ npm install -g generator-webapp
</pre>
        <p>You can always install another generator, for example for Backbone or AngularJS, if you want to start a project with those frameworks.</p>
        <h2>Step 4: Create your project</h2>
        <p>Create your project directory, and then run the generator to create all the files and folders you need to get started. &nbsp;In this case I’ve used the standard webapp-generator, which is invoked with the name “webapp”.</p>
        <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">$ mkdir ~/projects/frabulator
$ cd ~/projects/frabulator
$ yo webapp
</pre>
        <p>Lots of the generators will ask you some questions about exactly what features you want or need. &nbsp;You can always tweak this stuff later, but it’s worth getting it right if you can, this is all about making things quick and easy!</p>
        <h2>Step 5 … there is no Step 5</h2>
        <p>That’s it. &nbsp;You should see lots of stuff is created in the directory, and your project is set up and ready to go. &nbsp;But what does that mean?</p>
        <p>From here on in, you will be using <em>grunt</em>  (mostly) and&nbsp;<em>bower</em> &nbsp;(occasionally). &nbsp;You can use bower to install any new dependencies you might want, for example “howler” if you want to use that for web audio.</p>
        <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">$ bower install howler
</pre>
        <p>Far more often though, you will be using grunt to serve (with live reload!), test and build your application. &nbsp;The following three commands are the most common things you will do from here on in:</p>
        <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">$ grunt server
# ... this will launch a webserver on port 9000 (by default),
# ... it will launch&nbsp;the index in your browser, and will live
# ... reload if you save changes to some&nbsp;project files
$ grunt test
# ... this will &nbsp;run your test suite. &nbsp;Exactly what this
# ... means depends on&nbsp;your app, and the generator you
# ... used, but generally it will run in a&nbsp;headless webkit
# ... "phantom" browser
$ grunt build
# ... run the tests and package your app for distribution,
# ... in 'dist/'
</pre>
        <p>There are more grunt commands built in. &nbsp;To get an idea, you can refer to the Gruntfile.js that your generator created for you, and obviously the Grunt.js documentation.</p>
