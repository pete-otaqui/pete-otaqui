        <p>Zach Lipton, a blogger over at
          <a href="http://mozillazine.org/">Mozillazine</a>, shows himself to be a real human being in his post –
          <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/zach/archives/017885.html">The World Is Not Flat</a> . His description of the difference between the reporting on the VA Tech shootings and the ongoing violence ni Baghdad demonstrates an all-too-rare awareness of the world beyond the mass media.</p>
        <p>It’s also worth noting that the comments (3 at the time of writing) range from blazÃ© – “that’s how news work” (sic) – to downright ignorant – “there’s a war on there” (it’s not a ‘war’, it is a military occupation).</p>
        <p>Well done, Zach, and remember that you carry your own values and it’s never worth letting them go just because other people don’t always measure up.</p>
