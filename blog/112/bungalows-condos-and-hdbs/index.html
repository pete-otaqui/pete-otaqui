        <p>When does a bungalow have more than one floor?&nbsp; When it’s in Singapore of course!&nbsp; Every home that isn’t a high-rise here is called a “bungalow”.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of people live in HDBs – which are apartment blocks built by the Housing Development Board.&nbsp; The better off, not all of whom are expats, tend to live in Condos, that is smaller plusher blocks with a lot of their own private
          facilities such as a swimming pool, tennis courts … and in our case something laughably known as a “putting green”.</p>
        <p>Speaking of our case – we’ve put up
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pete_otaqui/sets/72157607876377364/">some pictures of our flat on flickr</a> .</p>
