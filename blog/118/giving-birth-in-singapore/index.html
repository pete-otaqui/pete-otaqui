          </a> We’re having a baby!</p>
        <p>I guess quite a few people who read this might already know that, but for those who don’t I thought I’d share the news :) We’re really excited about our family growing, and its a daily joy counting the days and gradually watching Laura’s tummy
          grow!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laura’s about 14 weeks pregnant now and baby is 13 weeks old (did you know that there’s some confusion about exactly how you count that? Different places use different systems) and we’re due middle of April 2009. About 6 months to go!</p>
        <p>In the meanwhile, here are some pics (taken last week) of our baby. We still don’t know the sex, that we’ll find out when we have our detailed scan at 20 weeks. Exciting!</p>
