        <p>My mac terminal came with a default prompt which looked like this:</p>
        <pre>Vigor:~ pete$ </pre>
        <p>I had changed my computer name to something I preferred, which works fine for browsing to your own apache server, but this did not have any effect on thebash prompt. I also wasn’t (yet) interested in customising the prompt with a bashrc file as
          suggested all over the web.</p>
        <p>It turned out that the terminal was showing the hostname of the machine, not the computer name. You can set the hostname with the following snippet:</p>
        <pre>$ sudo hostname whatever-you-want</pre>
        <p>This would give you a prompt like this:</p>
        <pre>whatever-you-want:~ pete$</pre>
        <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  the above method does not <em>permanently</em>  change the hostname. It will revert once you reboot. I’ve tried another method which seems better:</p>
        <pre>$ sudo scutil --set HostName whatever-you-want.example.com</pre>
