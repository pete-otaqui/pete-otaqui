          <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/">ReadWriteWeb</a>  has an interesting but not exactly deeply thought-out
          <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/link_journalism.php">piece on Link Journalism</a> . I think the point they miss is to question how much journalism done for mainstream media channels is nothing more than repitition of the day’s news agenda – it’s not a coincidence that most journalists’ bosses are
          called <em>editors</em> .</p>
        <p>Haven’t you ever noticed how many news channels at any given time are just churning through the same few Reuters or AP stories as everybody else?Â&nbsp; This can be potentially, if not in fact usually, less “original” than more obviously link-based
          journalism as there is inevitably less freedom and multi-lateralism in the sources.</p>
        <p>Then again, I went to art college I have even read
          <a href="http://social.chass.ncsu.edu/wyrick/debclass/whatis.htm">Death of the Author</a>  so I guess I’ve been a bit brainwashed.</p>
