          </a> Just got back from a visit to
          <a href="http://www.birdpark.com.sg/">Jurong Bird Park</a>, and it was excellent!</p>
        <p>Aside form the very typical Singaporean boast of the “largest manmade waterfall in the world” the park contains some real wonders, set out along very easy-to-follow lines.&nbsp; Sometimes that’s by region, and sometimes by order; for example “African
          Plains” is one area while “Parrot Paradise” covers a form of bird found in many places.</p>
        <p>They also have a regular set of “shows”, including watching birds being fed and also some set in an anphitheatre.&nbsp; We caught an excellent one – supposedly for children – that demonstrated some of the intelligence and playfullness of a series
          of parrots.</p>
        <p>All in all a really nice day out, and I’d definitely rate it above the Night Safari.</p>
        <p>We’ve uploaded
          <a title="Jurong Bird Park Flickr Set" href="http://flickr.com/photos/pete_otaqui/sets/72157608142894193/">some pictures of the birds</a> .</p>
