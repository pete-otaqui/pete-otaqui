        <p>So we’re all packed and ready to go.</p>
        <p>We’ve got to make one final trip to a mall – which is as appropriate a way as any to say goodbye to Singapore – to drop off our internet equipment, visit the bank and buy books for the journey back to the UK.</p>
        <p>Then we’ll just be hanging around for a while until the landladies come and pick the keys up, and it’s off to Changi to fly back to Heathrow on Emirates.</p>
        <p>We change at Dubai and the second leg will be on an Airbus A380 “Super Jumbo”. I’m planning on pleading with the check-in folks about Laura’s being pregnant and having a bad back for the very remote chance that they upgrade us … either way should
          be interesting.</p>
        <p>So – see in England!</p>
