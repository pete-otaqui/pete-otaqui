        <p>Since I switched to a Macbook Pro, I’ve felt the absence of the “Delete” key. It’s not the same as the Backspace key even in text-based applications, let alone in other things such as a web browser.</p>
        <p>To the rescue comes
          <a href="http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/index.html">Double Command</a>, a Preference Pane add-in that will give you quite a number of options, including the somewhat obvious to my mind “Shift + Backspace acts as delete.”</p>
        <p>It has quite a nice way of allowing a System setup, a User setup and a Current setup, and a pretty hefty number of altered key options, however I was happy to just stick to the one change (I’m a big fan of the extra “Enter” key next to the arrow
          keys, and somewhat miffed that it might disappear).</p>
