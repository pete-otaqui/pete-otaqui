        <p>According to a study in the latest issue of
          <a href="http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/">Injury Prevention</a>, car crashes kill 400 times more people than international terrorism in the 29 (developed) member countried of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) between 1994 and 2003.</p>
        <p>From the
          <a href="http://www.infowars.com/articles/terror/car_crashes_kill_400_times_more_than_terrorism.htm">InfoWars article on the study</a> :</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>… the number of Americans who avoided flying after 9/11 and were subsequently killed in car crashes was higher than the total number of passengers who died on the four 9/11 flights.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Should we have draconian new laws and fundamentally change the way our society works as a result?Â&nbsp; The changes would save <em>vastly</em>  more lives than stop-and-search routines at airports and train stations.</p>
