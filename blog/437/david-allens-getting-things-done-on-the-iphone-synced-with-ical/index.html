        <p>If you are a fan of GTD, use a Mac and an iPhone, then there’s a great pair of apps you can get that seamlessly sync all your projects and tasks, and that will update your iCal while you’re at it.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>  from Cultured Code also comes as an
          <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/iphone">iPhone app</a>, and the duo update each other fairly well. They miss out on being being “excellent” because the iPhone-to-mac syncing only happens when both your devices are on the same wifi network, and short of closing one of the pair and
          re-opening it, I can’t fnd a way of forcing a sync to happen whenever you would like.</p>
        <p>That being said, they do both work extremely well. The desktop version has a very nice quick-entry interface which feels a little bit like
          <a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>  (and is accessed by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Space) which is a nice touch. Both apps use “dock badge” numbers although the number shown can only be customised on the desktop version which lets you set the number as Due, Due+Today and
          Due+Today+Inbox; the iPhone dock badge will only show Due+Today so personally although I would like the full count I leave the setting so that both are the same.</p>
        <p>Neither app is free. The desktop client is (at the current exchange rate) £37.13 ($49.95) and you can buy Things from the App Store for £5.99 ($7.99). The desktop version is also available as a 5-license bundle for £55.72 ($74.95)</p>
