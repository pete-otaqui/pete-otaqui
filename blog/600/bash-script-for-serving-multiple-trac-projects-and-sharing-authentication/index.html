        <p>I use Trac for personal projects, and I share some of these out with people as required. I use tracd (TracStandalone) for this, rather than a full-blown apache setup, since it serves my needs quite nicely and is a lot easier to turn on and off
          as required without tweaking apache config and rebooting the whole webserver.</p>
        <p>All my projects live under a single parent directory, and I prefer to share a single users digest file between them all – so ideally I wanted to share a single tracd to run all my projects. This is fairly straightforward on the command line:</p>
        <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">tracd --hostname=webhost.com -p 9876 \
--auth="*,/path/projects/people.htdigest,Realm" \
/path/projects/p1 \
/path/projects/p2
</pre>
        <p>That is ….
          <br> Line 1 – start tracd for a given hostname and port,
          <br> Line 2 – specify auth for all projects (*), the auth file and the “Realm” you specified when creating the file with apache’s htdigest command
          <br> Lines 3+ – specify as many projects as you want to run</p>
        <p>This is ok with a couple of projects, but gets unwieldy quite quickly. What I needed was a little shell script to open up all projects under a given directory quickly. Here’s what I came up with:</p>
        <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">#!/bin/bash
# make / truncate a temp file to store names:
temp=/tmp/tracdpaths
&gt; $temp
# specify base directory:
base=/path/projects/
# output all subdirectories to temp file:
find $base -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d \
-exec echo -n "{} " &gt; $temp \;
# now start tracd
tracd --hostname=webhost.com -p 9876 \
--auth="*,/path/projects/people.htdigest,Realm" \
`cat $temp`
</pre>
        <p>Essentially this script uses ‘find’ to get all of the directories exactly 1 level down from your projects directory, and will echo their paths to a temp file (suppressing the newlines). It will then run run tracd, appending the contents of this
          file to the end of the call.</p>
