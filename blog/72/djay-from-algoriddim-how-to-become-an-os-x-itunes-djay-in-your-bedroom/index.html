          <a href="http://www.algoriddim.net/">Djay from algoriddim.com</a>  is an awesome piece of software. It plugs into your itunes library and lets you spin and mix on two virtual record decks.</p>
        <p>The application is intuitive and easy, and the best facsimile I’ve ever seen of actually spinning the wheels of steel on a computer. Combined with the fact that it’s free this is a brilliant application to play around with and to have up and running
          at parties.</p>
        <p>Key features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>drag and drop straight onto the ‘decks’ from a searchable list of your itunes library;</li>
          <li>manually tap out the bpm of your tracks and have djay automatically adjust the tempo of either playing track to the other;</li>
          <li>cue points which let you specify three points of a record and jump back to them at the click of a button;</li>
          <li>independent tempo and pitch adjustments – alter the pitch without affecting the tempo, or use both together to get a different tempo and the original pitch;</li>
          <li>crossfader automation, independently affecting tempo, pitch, eq and pan;</li>
          <li>easy recording of your masterpiece mixes.</li>
          <li>pre cueing (if you have a multi-channel sound card or a USB iMic) to listen to one track on your headphones while playing the other through the speakers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All in all an excellent application which takes seconds to start having fun with and offers enough features to let you lose yourself in the mix.</p>
