        <p>That’s right – our time here in Singapore is coming to an end.&nbsp; It’s been short (four months) but very sweet.&nbsp; It’s unfortunate that I came here to work for a startup whose product was aimed at being sold to hedge funds just at the moment
          of a global financial crisis, but things could be a lot worse for us.</p>
        <p>We’re not exactly sure where we’ll be living, I’ve got a couple of interviews lined up, but we’ll probably be staying with my parents in Somerset until we have something sorted out.</p>
        <p>We’ll be moving fairly quickly – before the end of the month – since Laura is pregnant she won’t be able to fly safely for much longer.&nbsp; Personally I think anything past 30 weeks is getting a bit close and we’ll be around 28.</p>
        <p>Our landladies have been absolutely great after an initial freak-out that we were breaking our contract.&nbsp; They’ve found another tenant for the flat who wants to move in quite soon, which has meant we’ve actualy ended up with a bit of a refund,
          *and* they even bought our cot and pram (which, I’m pretty certain, they have absolutely no use for).&nbsp; They’ve been great, and although I doubt they read this blog, I’d like to say a big thank you anyway.</p>
        <p>All in all, we’ve had nice little adventure in coming here – Singapore is a great place to live if you like hot weather, incredibly clean and green surroundings, and a fantastic melting pot of peoples and cultures. See you all in the UK sometime
          soon!</p>
