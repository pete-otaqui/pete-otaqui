        <p>In London I was used to a 40 minute walk to work, which I didn’t mind at all – especially since public transport would take about 30 minutes anyway.</p>
        <p>I’m in much the same situation here – it’s about half an hour to walk and 25 minutes by bus.&nbsp; However the problem here is that after walking for more than about 10 minutes you get very sweaty, and it’s not a nice way to arrive at the office
          every day.</p>
        <p>It’s a shame because I find walking to work a great way to get some gentle exercise.&nbsp; Fortunately since we live in a Condo, we have a pool right on our doorstep!</p>
