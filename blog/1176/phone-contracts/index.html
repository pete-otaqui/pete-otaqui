        <p>My mobile phone contract is due for renewal. I’ve been calculating some costs and it seems that getting a “free” phone on an 18 or 24 month contract is not actually all that economical – you end up paying more than you would by buying the phone
          outright and then choosing a “sim-only” deal. You obviously also tend to get the freedom to change your deal more easily and you will get an unlocked phone that can be used with any network.</p>
        <p>An exception to this rule seems to be if you get a bundle of not only mobile phone provision, but also broadband. One of the best in terms of price when you do get a bundle seems to be
          <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/broadband/">O2 Broadband</a> . I also like the idea of just getting one bill. Unfortunately for me, we don’t have the BT wiring in our house so can’t get that deal.</p>
        <p><span id="more-1176"></span> </p>
        <p>Virgin, who I get my broadband from, don’t seem to be nearly so competitive – at least in the brackets of broadband and mobile usage that I’m interested in.</p>
        <p>So I’m looking at unlocked providers like
          <a href="http://www.clove.co.uk">Clove</a>  to buy the phone and a truly budget service provider like
          <a href="http://www.talkmobile.co.uk">Talk Mobile</a> .</p>
        <p>If you’re interested, I’m particularly looking at a “tough phone” like the Motorola Defy, or even better the Xperia Play. I currently have an iPhone and while I’ve been very happy with it, I think I’ll be able to make the jump to Android, especially
          since you can now use a Google Apps account as the main one, rather than only a Gmail account. I’m also very keen to try in Mozilla’s
          <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G">Boot to Gecko</a>  project when that reaches some level of maturity (I was very keen on HPs WebOS too, but that never took off).</p>
        <p>You might guess that my requirements are a) cost and b) durability. That’s right: I’m a father.</p>
