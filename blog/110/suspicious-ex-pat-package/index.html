        <p>Once we’d booked our flights, I set about trying to find work – mostly using
          <a title="Monster Singapore" href="http://otaqui.com/blog/110/suspicious-ex-pat-package/www.monster.com.sg">www.monster.com.sg</a>  – and it didn’t turn out to be too hard.</p>
        <p>I was offered a job working for a local startup company, whose business is in rich media and financial reporting.&nbsp; Since I’m working for a local company, and haven’t been sent to Singapore by a large corporate, I don’t get all the package
          benefits that such people do (accommodation paid for, flights ‘home’, etc).</p>
        <p>That being said, my wages should be fine for us to have a good life on, and if L should do some work (currently she’s thinking about retraining) it would just be a bonus.&nbsp; Also we’ll be keeping our flat in London, and renting it out, so all
          in all we’re in a fairly stable position (credit crunch notwithstanding).</p>
        <p>The other option for us would have taken quite a bit of doing.&nbsp; The most likely route would have been to start getting work for financial organisations here in London, instead of mostly media ones, and then work on a posting out to Singapore
          from there working for the same company.&nbsp; This could have taken years and would not have been much fun – so all in all we’re pretty happy with the way things have worked out.</p>
        <p>Oh yes, I also get some stock options in the startup so if things do go well and the company floats then we might do very well indeed!</p>
