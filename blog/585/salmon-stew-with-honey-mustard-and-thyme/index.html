        <p>I fancied something different for dinner, and without much in the cupboards managed to come up with this delicious, and very healthy, dish that couldn’t be simpler to make.</p>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <p>• 4 salmon fillets
          <br> • several sprigs of tenderstem brocolli, some french beans, or other green
          <br> • good cherry tomatoes
          <br> • wholegrain mustard
          <br> • honey
          <br> • thyme
          <br> • white wine (optional) </p>
        <p>Method</p>
        <p>Turn the oven on, quite hot (200 degrees or more).</p>
        <p>Cut the salmon into good sized chunks, and the veg however you like – chuck all this in an oven dish with a lid.</p>
        <p>Mix a good tablespoon or so of honey with a couple of good teaspoons of mustard, a teaspoon of thyme and some salt and pepper with either 200ml of white wine (or water) and a tablespoon of cornflour (or normal plain flour). Combine very well,
          pour over the fish and vegetables and stir.</p>
        <p>Cover and put in the oven.</p>
        <p>After about 25 minutes crack the lid and stir again. Cook for a further 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Serve with rice. Yum!</p>
