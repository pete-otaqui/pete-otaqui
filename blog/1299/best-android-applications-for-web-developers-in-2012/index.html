        <p>This is a personal list of apps that I find most useful for myself – your mileage may vary.</p>
        <p>

          <!-- more -->
        </p>
        <h1>
          <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.connectbot">ConnectBot</a> 
        </h1>
        <p>ConnectBot is a rather nice SSH client, fairly&nbsp;indispensable&nbsp;for most people connecting to a linux box. &nbsp;It’s hugely improved by using the Hacker’s Keyboard.</p>
        <p>I haven’t included any native code editing apps in this list since, lets face it, Vi and / or emacs leaves them all in the dust – and connecting to a server with ConnectBot gives you the full editing power of a real editor.</p>
        <h1>
          <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard">Hackers Keyboard</a> 
        </h1>
        <p>One of the ways that Android is a more&nbsp;<em>powerful</em>  platform, that gives more&nbsp;<em>responsibility</em>  to its users compared to iOS is the ability to change input methods. &nbsp;The Hackers Keyboard gives you, with a bit of tweaking
          if you are using a phone rather than a tablet, a full keyboard including Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Function keys etc. &nbsp;Fairly indispensable if you’re using ConnectBot or other SSH client, and in quite a few other cases as well.</p>
        <h1>
          <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.giant">Google Analytics</a> 
        </h1>
        <p>This assumes obviously that you use GA on your sites, but if you do it’s really very nice to have quick access to data while you’re out and about.</p>
        <h1>
          <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android">Dropbox</a>  and
          <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs">Google Drive</a> 
        </h1>
        <p>A couple of similar apps here – but both give you a local copy of files you store online. &nbsp;This is a fantastic form of backup, but if you store anything sensitive do bear in mind the risks of losing your phone.</p>
        <h1>
          <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.metago.astro">Astro File Manager</a> 
        </h1>
        <p>Not related to being a developer directly, but extremely useful in all sorts of contexts. &nbsp;You can also install various plugins including bluetooth and SMB (i.e. Samba) modules to increase your sharing options. &nbsp;Unfortunately this file
          manager is as ugly as every other file manager I’ve seen for Android.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some other apps worth checking out:</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hullomail.messaging.android">HulloMail</a> &nbsp;– visual voicemail in a similar form to iOS, although ugly it does have some nice (premium) features like emailing voicemail to you.
          <br>
          <a href="http://www.swype.com/">Swype Keyboard</a> &nbsp;– a fantastic form of keyboard entry, installed by default on some Android phones, but available (as an *.apk file) to anyone
          <br>
          <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clov4r.android.nil">MoboPlayer</a> &nbsp;– play almost any video format, with software decoding if your device doesn’t support a given codec natively.</p>
