        <p>It’s pretty straightforward to set a custom user agent with mechanize if you’re using it directly,
          <a href="http://www.kickasslabs.com/2009/03/31/quick-hits-setting-the-user-agent-header-in-webrat/">KickAssLabs has a good example</a> .</p>
        <p>If you’re using Mechanize through Webrat though, things are a little different. The nice thing though, is that you can do this in a step definition – allowing features to be based on different browser scenarios (this is great if you’re developing
          across devices).</p>
        <p>First off there are two accessors of interest in mechanize, “user_agent” and “user_agent_alias”. The former is fairly self evident and lets you define the user agent at will, the latter gives you shortcut access to a list of common user agents
          baked into mechanize. You can see that list in
          <a href="http://github.com/tenderlove/mechanize/blob/master/lib/mechanize.rb#L48">the mechanize.rb source</a> . It contains some desktop browsers, the iPhone and the default Mechanize UA strings.</p>
        <p>If you’re happy with the default alias list, you can just write a step definition like this:</p>
        <pre class="brush: ruby; title: ; notranslate" title="">Given /^I am using the "(.*)" browser$/ do |browser|
  webrat.adapter.mechanize.user_agent_alias = browser 
end
</pre>
        <p>And then you can use this in your features:</p>
        <pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">Given I am using the "iPhone" browser
When I visit the home page
Then I should see "You are using an iPhone!"
</pre>
        <p>If you want to be able to specify your own UA strings, and as I said this is especially likely if you are developing cross-device applications where capabilities are important, then you can just use your own hash instead, and set “user_agent”
          rather than “user_agent_alias”:</p>
        <pre class="brush: ruby; title: ; notranslate" title="">Given /^I am using the "(.*)" browser$/ do |browser|
  UA_ALIASES = {
    "Nokia N95" =&gt; "Mozilla/5.0 (SymbianOS/9.2; .....",
    "Palm Pre" =&gt; "Mozilla/5.0 (webOS/1.0; ....."
  }
  webrat.adapter.mechanize.user_agent = UA_ALIASES[browser] 
end
</pre>
        <p>With a little tweaking you could use both the included list and, if the string from your feature isn’t there, look in a custom list too.</p>
