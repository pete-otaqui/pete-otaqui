        <p>If you ever do code reviews with a) more than about 3 people or b) a distributed team, you’ll know that everybody sitting around a desk is not workable all the time.</p>
        <p>A great workaround is to use ‘tmux’ (think GNU Screen for grown ups). It instantly offers you multiple-users attached to the same session.</p>
        <p>[Update 2012-04-14] Even better – use
          <a href="https://github.com/zolrath/wemux">wemux</a> !</p>
        <p><span id="more-1188"></span> </p>
        <p>You might, if you care about such things, want to do a bit of setup first. Assuming you’re using a *nix-based operating system (not too unlikely if tmux is an option for you) I recommend the following:</p>
        <p>* Setup a single user account on a machine to be used for code reviews
          <br> * Log in as that user and start tmux.
          <br> * Open up a few windows and files relating to the review ready to go
          <br> * Bonus points for some panes containing command line invocations; log tails; load monitors
          <br> * I recommend that you use a chat mechanism out of this window, preferably with voice + typing capabilities (Skype, Google+ Hangout, whatever)
          <br> * Extra bonus points if window 0 in your tmux session has a review agenda</p>
