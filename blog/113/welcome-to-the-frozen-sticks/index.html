        <p>This might sounds ridiculous, but we were cold for the first time since we arrived (3 weeks ago) last night.</p>
        <p>We went to the Cinema – The Picture House, which is part of the Cathay Cineplex – and the air conditioning was so strong, coupled with sitting still for two hours, that we relished the baking 11pm heat as we left. &nbsp;This pleasure was soon
          curtailed by another freakishly-strong-ac-setup in the taxi on the way home, but I guess since it makes you appreciate the heat which sometimes feels stifling it’s no bad thing.</p>
        <p>We went to see “
          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1064932/">Welcome to the Sticks</a> ” (Bienvenue Chez les Ch’tis) a not-too-taxing french comedy about a confirmed southerner having to move to … “The North”. &nbsp;Given that Les Ch’tis (the name of the people and the language from the region) are thought
          to be rough, uncultured, french-fry-eating, alcoholic simpletons who exist in a near-frozen wasteland I sort of felt like the protagonist had in fact landed himself in the UK, and felt right at home.</p>
