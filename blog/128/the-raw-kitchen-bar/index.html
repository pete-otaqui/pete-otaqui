        <p>Just come back from the Raw Kitchen Bar with our friend Sami, and had a fairly similar spread of dishes to
          <a href="http://skinny-epicurean.blogspot.com/2008/12/raw-kitchen-bar.html">The Skinny Epicurean’s group’s choices</a>  – the Ahi Mango Poke and a flipped-and-fried dumpling to start; followed by the Salmon, the Lamb and the Duck for mains.</p>
        <p>We were left too stuffed for desserts, but the coffee was spot on.</p>
        <p>The ambience of the place is fantastic and the friendly owners and staff have found the perfect balance of being on-hand and helpful while also letting you enjoy your meal and companions.</p>
        <p>We found the food to be excellent, and I must admit that I will find it hard to order something other than the duck if (or more likely <em>when</em> ) we go back!</p>
        <p>The Raw Kitchen is a real hidden gem!</p>
