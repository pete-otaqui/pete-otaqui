        <p>As part of an interesting exercise at work, I built an implementation of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game Of Life</a>  in Javascript. If you haven’t come across the Game Of Life, it’s really quite interesting and worth looking at. My colleagues also made variations, including canvas-based and Web GL 3 dimensional (there was even discussion
          about n-dimensional, with sliders to view the 4th, 5th and further dimensions). My particular take was to make the game space “infinite” rather than a fixed grid.</p>
        <p>It’s not really infinite of course, I haven’t made any attempt to have a position greater than Number.MAX_VALUE. The real point is that it is possible to have a huge playing area, and only the living &amp; possibly-living-next-round cells are
          taken into account.</p>
        <p>I avoided using any ready-made frameworks, in part so that it could be transported to the server-side on top of something like
          <a href="http://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>  – I was imagining a multi-player game where each user could “paint” cells onto the canvas, and maybe even that next-generation cells would take an identifier from their parents, letting people “fight”. I haven’t really got the time
          for that at the moment, but it seemed a nice idea.</p>
