        <p>I have an OS X host computer, running an Ubuntu guest, and I found that the guest could not create symlinks in a shared folder.</p>
        <p>All the permissions were fine, I could create, modify and delete files and directories in the shared folder from the guest, and existing symlinks worked as expected, but I could not create any new symlinks.</p>
        <p>It seems that this behaviour was intentionally introduced as a security measure to stop guests being able to create symlinks outside of the shared folder area.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10085#comment:12">Trac ticket 10085</a>  on the VirtualBox has some good information, but here is the fix (which you need to run from the host machine):</p>
        <pre>VBoxManage setextradata GUEST_NAME VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/SHARE_NAME 1
