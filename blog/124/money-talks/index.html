        <p>There’s a really obvious difference between discussing money here and in the UK.&nbsp; We Britons, and in my experience most Europeans, won’t ask someone how much they paid for something except in somewhat limited circumstances – they might be
          a good friend or when the question is purely informative and the product is commodotized (e.g. “How much do you pay for bread in Tescos?”).</p>
        <p>In Singapore, it’s perfectly acceptable for *anyone* to ask how much you paid for *anything*, including quite large things like your apartment.&nbsp; Given that rent is always a negotiation, this is somewhat embarrassing to my temperament since
          it would seem to be a reflection of one’s ability to haggle.</p>
        <p>Perhaps I’m just oversensitive :)</p>
