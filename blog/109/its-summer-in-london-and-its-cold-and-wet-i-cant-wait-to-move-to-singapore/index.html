        <p>Welcome to the blog!&nbsp; I’ll be writing about our family’s experience of moving from the UK to Singapore.&nbsp; We fly out on the 22nd of September, so the first few posts will be about why we’re going and what it’s like to get ready to emmigrate.</p>
        <h3>Why Singapore?</h3>
        <p>Many people ask us why Singapore, so I guess that’s a good place to start.&nbsp; L and I decided that we wanted to live abroad even before we were married last year; it’s not that surprising since we both had international childhoods.&nbsp; We
          considered moving to the Middle East as we have links there, but in the end that actually weighed against the region – we wanted somewhere new, and since neither of us have much experience of Asia (L has travelled there a little, but I’ve never
          been at all) it quickly became our first choice.</p>
        <p>Having settled on Asia in general, Singapore cropped up as a good choice for quite quickly – being a modern, clean and safe place (we are thinking of starting a family after all!) as well as having English as the language of business and lots
          of work for web developers like me.&nbsp; As a key trading port, it also has amazing links to all its neighbours, which is a definite plus.</p>
        <p>There is also the constant 30 degrees weather all year round.&nbsp; Nice.</p>
        <h3>But you won’t be able to chew gum will you?</h3>
        <p>People’s reaction to hearing that you are moving to Singapore usually come in two forms: those who are excited and those who start talking about chewing gum.&nbsp; For some reason, although Singapore has been both a model for reasoned development
          and at times harshly authoritarian – it’s the law (which I gather are far less strict than they used to be – more to come later, I’m sure!) prohibiting chewing gum which seems to resonate most with people here in the UK.&nbsp; I’m personally
          not bothered about not being able to chew gum, and I certainly won’t mind not having it stuck to my shoes.</p>
        <p>As to the greater issue of Singapore’s politics, I think it’s a bit more complicated than that.&nbsp; Coming from London – where I believe we have more CCTV cameras per person than any other city on earth – I can’t really imagine that it will
          seem very different.</p>
        <h3>It’s a long way, isn’t it?</h3>
        <p>I suspect the hardest part of moving to Singapore is going to be the distance from our families and friends.&nbsp; Obviously that is the price one has to pay for exploring somewhere new.&nbsp; I’m really glad that we’ll be able to video-conference
          with everybody, and plan on doing so as often as possible.&nbsp; There’s also this blog which I hope at least my mother will read on occasion!</p>
        <p>Well, I suppose that’s it for the first blog post.&nbsp; We’re quite busy before we go, but I will try posting some more before we fly!</p>
