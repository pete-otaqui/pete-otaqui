        <p>So I was around the house in Amman and heard what I recognised as the classic “Ice Cream Van” tune from the UK playing over very tinny speakers. I looked out of the window thinking it was a bit odd for a van like that to tour a residential area,
          and saw that it wasn’t ice creams, it was a flatbed truck full of gas canisters. Makes good sense really, there are no gas mains here so everyone uses the canisters, and it’s much easier to have them brought round rather than having to take
          them to a garage to replace them with full ones as it is in Blighty.</p>
