        <p>I had the best chocolate milkshake of my life last night, at the
          <a href="http://www.cioconatlounge.com/">Cioconat Lounge</a>  in Dabouq. The staff were extremely friendly, there was an mix of (mostly) chic Ammanis, foreigners and even a couple of families. We had a very pleasant “two apples” arghile, and my wife’s chai latte was also really nice
          too.</p>
        <p><span id="more-1322"></span> </p>
        <p>I was struck by the fact that the charcoal guy was incredibly proficient both at handling his material and also making sure that every smokers bowl was regularly tended, but in a way that would never be allowed in the UK since he regularly swung
          his bowl of hot coals to aerate them. More fool the Brits, really.</p>
        <p>Nice as the drinks were, I must admit that what really made the experience great was sitting outside enjoying the cool evening (that means 11pm around here!) air – we probably wouldn’t be too bothered about going to one of the other franchises
          that exist in the local malls.</p>
