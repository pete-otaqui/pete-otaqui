        <p>Facebook is doomed. I’m not talking about its share price or funding model, I’m talking about use patterns. Facebook is, essentially, a one-trick-pony; it’s <em>only</em>  a social network.</p>
        <p><span id="more-1333"></span> </p>
        <p>Google, on the other hand, is more or less everything. Almost as important as little things like <strong>search</strong>  and <strong>video</strong>  are, in my personal experience, Google Apps. If you’ve ever worked with a team of people where
          everyone uses Google for documents, spreadsheets, email, instant messaging, etc, etc, and you’ve suddenly found that you can use all the same controls / circles / etc for <em>everything</em>  you might have glimpsed just how compelling it can
          all be. There can be some niggles with multiple accounts, but apparently the engineers are working on that.</p>
        <p>When you really buy into the whole Google ecosystem, with Chrome, GMail, Google Apps and Android, you get a lot of benefits. You also give up lot of information about yourself, but that’s a discussion all of its own. All the services tie in and
          add up to a really compelling experience: search, email, im, office work, videos, music, books, telephone calls, etc, etc all work together. The work involved in this isn’t complete, and the experience has a way to go, but it gets better all
          the time. More importantly, no one else is in a position to offer anything even remotely so well integrated.</p>
        <p>I’d argue that the only company that comes close is Apple – and even they suffer from not having a truly unified experience – no search, obviously, but also not really well integrated email, documents, and IM. Apple also lacks any kind of social
          network, which Google obviously does have with Plus.</p>
        <p>So – about Plus. It’s only downside is that hardly anyone uses it. It suffers not only from “my friends aren’t on there” but also “why would I bother when I already use X other social platforms”. However I see these as short term issues, and that
          the overall direction is that Google will win, because they are the only ones offering everything.</p>
