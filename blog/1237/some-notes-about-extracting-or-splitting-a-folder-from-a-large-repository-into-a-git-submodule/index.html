        <p>There is a lot of great information on StackOverflow about splitting git trees into submodules. We followed
          <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/930286">this guide that suggests copying the repository and then using git-filter-branch</a> .</p>
        <p>We are in the situation where we had quite a lot of branches (around 30) that we wanted to maintain, and many of these included commits to the main repository and the directory that we were splitting off. We’ve discovered a few things along the
          way.</p>
        <p><span id="more-1237"></span> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure you’ve done as much merging as you can, and minimise the number of branches you want to move across.</li>
          <li>Take this as blocking project, and assume other work can’t really continue until this change has made it to master.</li>
          <li>Apply this change to all active unmerged branches asap.</li>
          <li>Where branches have commits across the new submodule boundary, you may need to create and apply patches since ‘git merge’ won’t work across the boundary, but ‘diff’ and ‘patch’ can.</li>
        </ul>
